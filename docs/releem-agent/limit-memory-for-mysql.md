# Limit Memory for MySQL

If your server has not only MySQL installed, but also other software like a web server, it is important to limit the memory allocated for MySQL using the memory_limit option in Releem Agent configuration. This option will inform Releem Platform to limit memory for MySQL and helps ensure that MySQL does not consume excessive resources and affect the performance of other applications on the server.

To set the memory limit follow the steps below:
1. Open the Dashboard->Recommended Configuration->Settings
2. Set new Memory Limit
3. Click Save Changes button

It takes up to 12 hours to update limit in the dashboard and up to 4 days to get first recommendations.
