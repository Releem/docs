# Deadlock Monitoring

Releem continuously monitors your MySQL database for deadlocks and provides instant notifications with complete transaction details. Deadlocks can cause application errors and degrade user experience, so early detection and resolution are critical for maintaining database reliability.

## How Releem Monitors Deadlocks

Releem continuously analyzes MySQL's internal status reports to detect deadlocks in real-time.

Releem automatically identifies the type of deadlock and provides suggestions on how to resolve it. All deadlock information, including identification and suggested fixes, is stored in your Releem dashboard for historical analysis to uncover recurring issues and patterns.
